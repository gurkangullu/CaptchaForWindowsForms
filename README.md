## How to use this library in any project?
Below you can see how a WinFormCaptcha object is created.

```csharp
using CaptchaForWinForms;

//The properties taken as parameter are as follows, respectively:
//Text length, width, height, include numeric char, include lower case char, include upper case char, 
//include symbol, include line on captcha, include noise on captcha, messy text, distort image.

WinFormCaptcha cp = new WinFormCaptcha(5, 100, 100, true, true, true, true, true, true, true);

//OR

//If you don't want to give the logical values of the features, all of them will be set to true value!
WinFormCaptcha cp = new WinFormCaptcha(5, 100, 100);
```

Below you can see how the Captcha image generated by the WinFormCaptcha object is shown to the user.

```csharp
panel.BackgroundImage = cp.DrawCaptcha();

//OR

pictureBox.Image = cp.DrawCaptcha();
```

Below you can see how the value of the user entered, the matching status of the value of the generated captcha image is checked.

```csharp
bool isCheckStatus = cp.CheckCorrect(userEnteredText);
```

Below you can see how the text and values in the captcha image are listened to.

```csharp
cp.ListenCaptcha();
```

Below you can see how the captcha image created is saved.

```csharp
//You can select any supported image format you want.
cp.SaveCaptcha(saveImagePath, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
```

You can review the codes and example project for more information. :blush:
